* Unit 2 - Basic Java Programming
Naming conventions for identifiers
+ Capitalize class names
  + HelloWorld
+ Do not capitalize method names
  + main
+ Capitalize internal words within the name
  + Hello/W/orld

- System.out.println(" ");
  + A piece of text like "hello world" is a /string literal/
    - Meaning it is of type string and /hard coded/ into the program

  + A string literal must be enclosed in double quotes ""
  + Can print a blank line by omitting the string literal
    - Just System.out.println();


- String Literals cannot span two lines
  + /Not allowed/ =System.out.println("I want to print a string=
                  =on two lines");=
  + Instead use: System.out.println("I want to print a string");
                 System.out.println("on two lines");
		 
		 + ~Does adding \n also work?~
		   - Yes, \n inserts a new line
- println vs print :
  + println - moves to the next line after printing,
    think of as adding a \n char to the end of everything
    by default
  
  + print - just like regular printf function in C,
    does not add any newline char

- Escape char \
  
  + Used to add 'forbidden' characters in print/println
  + \" for ", \n as newline, \t as tab, \\ as \
