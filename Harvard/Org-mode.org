* Org-mode tutorial and Notes
This is my file for working with org-mode.  In here, I will play around with org-mode and test out the
things that it is capable of.  I'm following the David O'Toole org-mode tutorial

* Tutorial
^^ This is a headline, denoted by one *.  Multiple can be used to create different 
sub-headers.  
** This is an example of a sub header
*** This is a sub-sub-header
Each one can be folded into itself using TAB to hide the text under it
*** Folding
will fold the header and all the sub-headers into one, but will skip any equal headers, 
such as *** and ***
**** This is a sub-sub-sub header
New equal headers can be inserted by using M-RET


* TO_DO Functionality
Todo items are denoted by TODO, they can be changed with SHIFT-Left Shift-Right
to denote different levels of completion, more can be added into the 
init.el
