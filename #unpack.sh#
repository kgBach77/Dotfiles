# A program to unpack my dotfiles on a new system.
# Mostly to just move around my emacs packages to
# get a new environment working easier

# Take all the files in the Dotfiles directory and copy them to the home directory,
# overriding anything that is already there.
# Then restart bash
# cp * ~/
