# Dotfiles

This is made up primarily of my emacs dotfiles with a few other from my laptop.  I found that it was much easier to dump these files on github 
rather than spend an extra hour or two typing the same problems into google and trying to figure out how to get urxvt to look right or how to 
get xrandr to scale to high-DPI screens properly.

My .emacs file is my own, in a way.  I've built it up over time by looking through various other .emacs files on github and pulling out piecemeal 
the featurs I found to be most useful, along with any other fiddly changes I've made to make it more comfortable.
